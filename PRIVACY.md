# Privacy Policy for Bilibili Search Plugin

Last updated: [Current Date]

This Privacy Policy describes how the Bilibili Search Plugin ("Plugin", "we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our plugin within the Dify platform.

## Information We Handle

The Bilibili Search Plugin requires access to your Bilibili account cookies to function. These cookies are provided by you and stored securely within your Dify environment's credential management system. The Plugin uses these cookies solely for the purpose of making authenticated requests to Bilibili's API on your behalf to:

*   Search for videos on Bilibili.
*   Retrieve video information from Bilibili.

**We do not collect or store your Bilibili cookies or any other personal information within the Plugin itself.** The cookies are managed by the Dify platform as per your configuration.

## How We Use Information

The Plugin acts as an intermediary to interact with the Bilibili platform. The information retrieved from Bilibili (such as video search results or video details) is passed directly back to you through the Dify interface. We do not process or store this information beyond the immediate execution of your requests.

## Third-Party Services

This Plugin interacts with Bilibili. Your use of Bilibili is subject to Bilibili's own privacy policy and terms of service. We encourage you to review Bilibili's policies to understand how they handle your data.

## Data Security

While the Plugin itself does not store your personal data, we rely on the security measures implemented by the Dify platform to protect your credentials.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
